## Directions

1. Turn pressure cooker to the *sauté* setting. 
2. Melt butter and sauté onion, celery, and carrots for about 5 minutes, until softened.
3. Add the split peas, chicken stock, ham (bone), and the bay leaves. 
4. Turn off the *sauté* function.
5. Cover pressure cooker and set to manual, high pressure for 15 minutes (old peas may take more time). 
6. Allow the pressure to naturally release for 10-15 minutes. Then, quick release the pressure valve.
7. If you used a ham bone or hock: remove bone from the soup but return any ham meat attached to it.
8. Taste and season with salt and pepper as necessary.

## Notes

-   **To make this in your slow cooker**, add all ingredients (omitting the butter) to slow cooker and cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4 hours, or until split peas are cooked to desired tenderness.
-   **To make this on your stovetop**, sauté veggies as instructed in a large pot. After adding the remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for approximately one hour (or until split peas are cooked to desired tenderness).
